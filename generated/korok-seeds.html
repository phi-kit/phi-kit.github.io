            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Korok Seeds are a collectible item in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There are a staggering 900 of them scattered across Hyrule, hidden within various environmental puzzles. Collecting them allows you to expand your inventory slots by giving them to Hestu. While finding all 900 is a monumental task, uncovering even a few can be incredibly rewarding and add to the joy of exploration.

        <section class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">

            <!-- Puzzle Type 1: Rock Circles/Patterns -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Rock Circles/Patterns</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/a0c49d/ffffff?text=Rock+Puzzle" alt="Korok Rock Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Often, you'll find an incomplete circle, square, or other pattern of rocks. Your task is to find the missing rock nearby (it usually stands out) and place it in the correct spot to complete the pattern. Sometimes, it's a single rock that's out of place in an otherwise perfect pattern.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 2: Sparkle Trails -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Sparkle Trails</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/c4d7b2/ffffff?text=Sparkle+Trail" alt="Korok Sparkle Trail" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Keep an eye out for a distinct trail of shimmering sparkles moving through the environment. Chase them down and interact with the source of the sparkles (usually a small, hidden Korok) before they disappear. This often requires quick movement or a good sense of direction.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 3: Pinwheels -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Pinwheels</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/e0ffcd/ffffff?text=Pinwheel+Puzzle" alt="Korok Pinwheel Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    When you see a pinwheel, it indicates a target-based puzzle. This could involve shooting balloons, acorns, or even moving targets that appear after you stand near the pinwheel. Use your bow and arrow or other ranged attacks to hit the targets.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 4: Block Puzzles -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Block Puzzles</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/b0e0e6/ffffff?text=Block+Puzzle" alt="Korok Block Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    These puzzles involve two identical structures made of metal blocks. One structure will be missing a block, and you need to use your Magnesis Rune to find the missing block nearby and place it into the incomplete structure to mirror the complete one.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 5: Water Lilies/Leaves -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Water Lilies/Leaves</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/87ceeb/ffffff?text=Lily+Pad+Puzzle" alt="Korok Lily Pad Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    In bodies of water, you might spot a circle of lily pads or leaves. Simply dive or jump into the center of the circle to reveal the hidden Korok. Sometimes, you'll need to create a splash from a height.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 6: Acorns/Pots -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Acorns/Pots</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/ffe0b2/ffffff?text=Acorn+Puzzle" alt="Korok Acorn/Pot Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Look for small, breakable objects like acorns hanging from trees or hidden in crevices, or small pots. Shoot them with an arrow or break them with a weapon to reveal the Korok. Listen for a distinct sound that indicates their presence.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 7: Tree Branches/Balloons -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Tree Branches/Balloons</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/d7f9e9/ffffff?text=Balloon+Puzzle" alt="Korok Balloon Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Sometimes, you'll find a single balloon tied to a tree branch or floating in the air. Shoot it with an arrow to pop it and reveal the Korok. These often require good aim and sometimes a bit of elevation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 8: Offering Puzzles -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Offering Puzzles</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/f0e68c/ffffff?text=Offering+Puzzle" alt="Korok Offering Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    You might encounter statues or small bowls where an item is missing. Find the exact item (often an apple, a specific type of fruit, or a weapon) and place it in the empty spot to complete the offering and summon the Korok.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Puzzle Type 9: Boulder Rolling -->
            <div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl p-6 flex flex-col items-center text-center">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Boulder Rolling</h3>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/400x250/c0c0c0/ffffff?text=Boulder+Puzzle" alt="Korok Boulder Puzzle" class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-4 object-cover">
                <p class="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Look for a large boulder positioned near a hole in the ground. Your goal is to roll or push the boulder into the hole. This often requires using Stasis, bombs, or even just pushing it manually down a slope.
                </p>

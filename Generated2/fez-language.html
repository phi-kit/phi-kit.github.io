        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">1. The Fezian Alphabet: Reading the World</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The most fundamental of FEZ's hidden languages is its alphabet, which appears frequently throughout the game world on signs, monoliths, and even the environment itself. This alphabet is based on a simple, elegant system: each letter is represented by a 2x2 block of pixels, with one pixel missing. The position of the missing pixel, combined with the rotation of the block, determines the letter.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                There are four possible positions for the missing pixel, and four possible rotations for each, yielding a total of 16 distinct symbols. These symbols map directly to the English alphabet (A-P). The remaining letters (Q-Z) are represented by rotating the existing symbols. This means that each symbol can represent multiple letters depending on its orientation.
            </p>
            <div class="fez-example">
                <p class="font-bold text-blue-200 mb-2">Example: Basic Fezian Alphabet Structure</p>
                <p class="fez-text">
                    [X O]<br>
                    [O O] = A (missing top-left)<br><br>
                    [O X]<br>
                    [O O] = B (missing top-right)<br><br>
                    [O O]<br>
                    [X O] = C (missing bottom-left)<br><br>
                    [O O]<br>
                    [O X] = D (missing bottom-right)
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-400">
                    (And then rotations of these basic shapes for other letters)
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Deciphering this alphabet often requires careful observation and sometimes even a pen and paper to map out the rotations. Once understood, players can translate the numerous messages scattered across the game, revealing lore, hints, and philosophical musings.

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">2. The Fezian Number System: Counting in Quadrants</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Complementing the alphabet is FEZ's unique number system, which is a base-4 system. Each digit is represented by a 2x2 block, similar to the alphabet, but instead of a missing pixel, it uses filled-in quadrants.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The numbers 0-3 are represented by filling in quadrants of a 2x2 square. For numbers greater than 3, the system uses positional notation, much like our decimal system, but with a base of 4.
            </p>
            <div class="fez-example">
                <p class="font-bold text-blue-200 mb-2">Example: Fezian Numbers</p>
                <p class="fez-text">
                    [O O]<br>
                    [O O] = 0 (no quadrants filled)<br><br>
                    [X O]<br>
                    [O O] = 1 (top-left filled)<br><br>
                    [O X]<br>
                    [O O] = 2 (top-right filled)<br><br>
                    [X X]<br>
                    [O O] = 3 (top-left and top-right filled)<br><br>
                    [O O]<br>
                    [X O] = 4 (bottom-left filled, which is 1 in the next place value)
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Understanding this number system is vital for solving certain puzzles, especially those involving numerical sequences or codes found on various artifacts. It's a subtle nod to the game's multi-dimensional nature, where even numbers have a spatial component.

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">3. The Tetromino Language: Rotational Secrets</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Perhaps the most intricate and mind-bending of FEZ's languages is the Tetromino language. This system is not about individual letters or numbers, but rather about directional inputs and rotations, reminiscent of the game's core mechanic. It's often used for secret phrases or actions that unlock hidden areas or crucial puzzle elements.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The Tetromino language uses the directional inputs (Up, Down, Left, Right) and the rotation buttons (Left Shift/Trigger, Right Shift/Trigger). Each "word" in this language is a sequence of these inputs, and the "meaning" is derived from the specific order and combination. These sequences often correspond to the shapes of Tetromino blocks, hence the name.
            </p>
            <div class="fez-example">
                <p class="font-bold text-blue-200 mb-2">Example: A Common Tetromino Phrase</p>
                <p class="fez-text">
                    Up, Up, Left, Right, Right Shift, Left Shift, Down, Down
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-400">
                    This sequence is famously used to open a certain door or activate a hidden mechanism. The challenge lies in recognizing these patterns and executing them correctly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                What makes this language so brilliant is its integration with the gameplay. Players aren't just decoding text; they are performing actions that *are* the language. It forces a deeper engagement with the game's controls and spatial reasoning, turning the controller into a cipher key.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">4. The "Glitches" and Hidden Meanings: Beyond the Surface</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Beyond the structured languages, FEZ also incorporates what appear to be "glitches" or corrupted data, which often contain profound messages. These are not true errors, but deliberate design choices that reinforce the game's meta-narrative about the collapse of dimensions and the nature of reality.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                These "glitch" messages, often presented in a distorted or rapidly changing format, hint at the game's deeper lore, the existence of other entities, and the very fabric of the universe Gomez inhabits. They encourage players to question what they see and to look for meaning in the chaos. This aspect of FEZ resonates with the thought-provoking nature of movies like "Inception" or "The Platform," where layers of reality and perception are constantly challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                The combination of these explicit and implicit linguistic elements creates a rich tapestry of storytelling that rewards curiosity and persistence. It's a game that respects the player's intelligence and rewards their willingness to delve into its secrets.
            </p>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">Conclusion: The Language of Discovery</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The hidden languages of FEZ are more than just clever puzzles; they are integral to the game's identity and its enduring appeal. They transform the act of playing into an act of discovery, making every deciphered message feel like a significant breakthrough. For a completionist like yourself, the satisfaction of uncovering every linguistic secret in FEZ must be immense, much like ticking off those checkboxes in Vampire Survivors.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                By mastering the Fezian alphabet, understanding its base-4 number system, and internalizing the Tetromino sequences, players don't just finish FEZ; they truly understand it. They become part of its world, speaking its ancient tongues, and uncovering its deepest, most philosophical questions. It's a testament to game design that can weave such intricate layers of meaning into its core mechanics, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.

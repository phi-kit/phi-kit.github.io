        <p>Welcome! I'm an independent start up, and I want to be your technology consultant. Ask me anything and I'll respond as soon as I can.</p>
        <p>Some things I've been working on lately.</p>
        <p>Where is this website hosted? I'm using GitHub to host this website. It's a place where source code can be stored. I don't have a custom domain name (that cost money) and I was able to get this running and maintained for free. And I have full control of everything here.</p>
